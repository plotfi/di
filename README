di - disk information utility (version 3.12).

DESCRIPTION

  'di' is a disk information utility, displaying everything
  (and more) that your 'df' command does. It features the
  ability to display your disk usage in whatever format you
  desire/prefer/are used to. It is designed to be portable
  across many platforms.

INSTALLATION

  Instructions:
                                  Example w/gcc and different prefix.
      make distclean                make distclean
      make                          make CC=gcc prefix=/usr/lbin
      make install                  make CC=gcc prefix=/usr/lbin install

    features/cflags.sh sets the various compiler flags.

    The CC, CFLAGS, prefix, LDFLAGS, and LIBS environment
    variables may be set and exported prior to running make.

    The LOCALEDIR environment variable may be set to the installation
    directory for the locale files.  Default is ${prefix}/lib/di/locale.

    If you want the internationalization directory installed, do:

      make install-po [en_US: 27-Aug-2002, de_DE: 26-Feb-2004]

    To force a 64 bit binary build:
      ./Build -64 [<args>]

  Installation Permissions:
    Some systems (Sys V variants) only allow root to read the
    mount table.  If this is the case, change the INSTPERM macro
    in the Makefile should be set to 4111, and the USER macro to root.
    In SysV.4 and Solaris, the mount command would reset the
    permissions to be root readable only (fixed in Solaris 7).

    If this is needed on your system, do:

    make installperms

  Windows installation:

    You may need to undefine _lib_GetDiskFreeSpaceEX
    in the config.h file for older windows systems.

    (1) and (2) will build using the windows API.
    (3) Doesn't find the windows API, and uses the cygwin API.

    If you prefer to use the cygwin API rather than the
    windows API, edit config.h, and undefine _hdr_windows,
    _lib_GetDiskFreeSpace, and _lib_GetDiskFreeSpaceEx,
    then re-run the build.

    Alternative 1)
        Cygnus gcc: make windows-gcc
        MS VC++:    nmake windows
    Alternative 2)
        ./Build distclean
        CC=gcc ./Build

        Cray UNICOS/mk, FreeBSD 1.x and 2.x, HP/UX, Linux,

        Sequent Dynix and PT/x, SGI Irix, Solaris, SunOS, Sys V.3,
        Sys V.4, Ultrix, Windows, Xenix

BUGS

    Solaris 2.6 has a bug in the kernel and reports the reserved
    space incorrectly.  There is a kernel patch available (105572-05?).

    Send bug reports along with the output from 'di -A -x 2' and the
    output from your standard df command (as verbose as possible) to:

        di-bugs@gentoo.com

    If the Build script doesn't set up the 'config.h'
    file correctly, please let me know.  E-mail me the incorrect
    (and corrected if possible) config.h file, and any other
    information as appropriate.  The goal is to be able to run
    Build in non-interactive mode for any system.

        Added getfsstat() for Compaq Tru-64 (and FreeBSD, etc.) systems.

        Fixed so di doesn't statfs() the disks it doesn't need to.
        Removed fs basetype stuff.
        Split out disk routines into separate module.  Lots of cleanup.
        Totals: fix to take into account block size of partition.
        Totals: ignore read-only, partitions not normally printed.
        Totals: ignore memory filesystems (tmpfs, memfs).

    2.3                                     [24 feb 2000]
        Modified hints for solaris to do 64 bit compilation.
        Removed extra libc setting for linux.
        Added support for BeOS.  This required ansi function headers.

        Hints for dec_osf added.
        Changed HAS_GETMNTINFOFSIZE to be preferred over
        HAS_GETMNTINFOBSIZE; modified bsdos hints appropriately.
        Look for <sys/fs_types.h> include file.

        Made installperm as separate target in makefile.
        Modified duplicate checking slightly.
        Changed MNT_NOWAIT to MNT_WAIT.  This will work better
        on FreeBSD.  Hopefully will work w/nfs mounts.

    2.0                                     [15 apr 1999]
        Now uses dist 3.0PL70 for configuration.
        Duplicate filesystems (automounted) are not displayed.
        This probably does not work for Digital's advfs.

    1.24
        Added Windows w/gcc.
        The Solaris 2.6 statvfs() bug has a patch out for it.
        Patch #105572-05 (?).

        Added Windows.  Don't know the routines to get the number
        of file slots or the file system type (FAT12/16/32).
        Changed default to display megabytes.

    1.21                                    [8 sep 1997]

    1.20
        Added Solaris large file system support.  Note that

        and the non-root available disk space is improperly
        reported.

    1.19                                    [4 feb 1996]
        Added mount time, mount options.  Link di to the mi command.
