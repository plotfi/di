di - disk information utility (version 3.0).

DESCRIPTION

  'di' is a disk information utility, displaying everything
  (and more) that your 'df' command does. It features the
  ability to display your disk usage in whatever format you
  desire/prefer/are used to. It is designed to be portable
  across many platforms.

INSTALLATION

  The installation process has been completely revamped
  beginning with version 3.0.  You now have a choice of
  'dist 3.0PL70' (Configure) or 'iffe'.  It is the intention
  to switch over to 'iffe' completely, once all issues with
  it have been resolved.

  Instructions for iffe:

    ./Build distclean             ./Build distclean
    ./Build                       CC=gcc prefix=/usr/lbin ./Build
    ./Build install               CC=gcc prefix=/usr/lbin ./Build install
    ./Build install-man           CC=gcc prefix=/usr/lbin ./Build install-man

    The CC, CFLAGS, prefix, LDFLAGS, and LIBS environment variables
    can be set and exported prior to running 'Build'. 

    If you don't have an C compiler that supports prototypes, you'll
    have to edit the config.h file by hand after it is created.

    features/cflags.sh messes with the various compiler flags.

  Instructions for Configure:

    ./Configure -d -s -e          # non-interactive
    ./Configure -d -s -e -Dcc=gcc # non-interactive, and you want to use gcc
    ./Configure                   # interactive

    Then, do your make:

    make

    And install:

    ( AIX versions prior to 4.3 had a 'di' command.  di is installed
    as 'diskinfo' instead for these AIX versions. )

    make install

    To install the manual pages:

    make install-man

  Installation Permissions:
    Some systems (Sys V variants) only allow root to read the
    mount table.  If this is the case, change the INSTPERM macro
    in the Makefile should be set to 4111, and the USER macro to root.
    In SysV.4 and Solaris, the mount command would reset the
    permissions to be root readable only (fixed in Solaris 7).

    If this is needed on your system, do:

    make -f Makefile.iffe installperm

  Windows installation:

    Alternative 1)
        cp config.win95 config.h
        Cygnus gcc: make -f Makefile.iffe windows-gcc
        MS VC++:    nmake -f Makefile.iffe windows
    Alternative 2)
        CC=gcc ./Build distclean
        CC=gcc ./Build
        *** if you prefer to use the cygwin API rather than the
            windows API, edit config.h, and undefine _hdr_windows,
            and _lib_GetDiskFreeSpace, then re-run the build.

PORTING

    di 3.0 has been tested on the following platforms (both
    Configure and iffe):
        Solaris 8 (cc 5.0, gcc 2.95.3)
           gcc on Solaris does things differently with the include
           files than cc 5.0 when large file support is defined.

    Due to the revamped configuration process, some of these systems
    may not be properly configured as I don't have access to all of the
    platforms to test on.

BUGS

    Solaris 2.6 has a bug in the kernel and reports the reserved
    space incorrectly.  There is a kernel patch available (105572-05?).

    Send bug reports along with the output from 'di -A -x 2' and the
    output from your standard df command (as verbose as possible) to:

        bll@gentoo.com

    If the Configure script doesn't set up the 'config.h' file
    correctly, please let me know.  E-mail me the incorrect (and
    corrected if possible) config.h file, and any other information
    as appropriate.  The goal is to be able to run Configure in
    non-interactive mode for any system.

CHANGES

    3.0
        Added getfsstat() for Compaq Tru-64 (and FreeBSD, etc.) systems.
        Compaq Tru-64 code cleaned up.
        Thanks to Compaq for their test drive program.
        More cleanup.  Added iffe configuration.
    2.4
        Fixed so di doesn't statfs() the disks it doesn't need to.
        Removed fs basetype stuff.
        Split out disk routines into separate module.  Lots of cleanup.
        Totals: fix to take into account block size of partition.
        Totals: ignore read-only, partitions not normally printed.
        Totals: ignore memory filesystems (tmpfs, memfs).
    2.3
        Modified hints for solaris to do 64 bit compilation.
        Removed extra libc setting for linux.
        Added support for BeOS.  This required ansi function headers.
    2.2
        Hints for dec_osf added.
        Changed HAS_GETMNTINFOFSIZE to be preferred over
        HAS_GETMNTINFOBSIZE; modified bsdos hints appropriately.
        Look for <sys/fs_types.h> include file.
    2.1
        Added +DAportable for HP-UX.
        Hints for openbsd added.
        Made installperm as separate target in makefile.
        Modified duplicate checking slightly.
        Changed MNT_NOWAIT to MNT_WAIT.  This will work better
        on FreeBSD.  Hopefully will work w/nfs mounts.
    2.0
        Now uses dist 3.0PL70 for configuration.
        Duplicate filesystems (automounted) are not displayed.
        This probably does not work for Digital's advfs.
    1.24
        Added Windows w/gcc.
        The Solaris 2.6 statvfs() bug has a patch out for it.
        Patch #105572-05 (?).
    1.23
        Improved Windows.
    1.22
        Added Windows.  Don't know the routines to get the number
        of file slots or the file system type (FAT12/16/32).
        Changed default to display megabytes.
    1.21
        Fixed AIX typo.
        Linux 2.x
    1.20
        Added Solaris large file system support.  Note that
        ver 2.6 Beta_Update has a bug in the statvfs() routine,
        and the non-root available disk space is improperly
        reported.
    1.19
        Added mount time, mount options.  Link di to the mi command.
    1.18
        Fixed some ignore/include list problems.  Fixed local mount
        flag for OSF/1.
    1.17
        Changed block values from unsigned long to doubles so that we
        can display using different block sizes (-d flag).
        Added -l flag for local filesystems only.
    1.16
        Added A/UX  [ blemoine@atheist.tamu.edu (Brett G. Lemoine) ]
        Added convex [ "Schilperoort J.W." <J.W.Schilperoort@research.ptt.nl> ]
    1.15
	Fixed bsdi 1.x and bsdi 2.x.  Fragments weren't supported.
	Fixed FreeBSD 1.x and 2.x; same problem.
        Changed sco_sl makefile entry.
    1.14
        Fixed problem with display widths in conjunction with
        ignore/include lists.
    1.13
        changed default length of filesystem type field to 7.
        new debug 'all' format.
        check for 0 fragment size; replace w/block size if we have it.
    1.12
        sco nfs 'nothing' fix.
        freebsd 2.x; better freebsd filesystem types.
    1.11
        bsdi
    1.10
        added freebsd.
    1.9
        makefile fixes.
    1.8
        removed mount option junk.
        added AIX.
    1.7
        cleaned up sgi in the makefile.
        changed linux to be w/o need_statfs_defs.
        solaris cdrom returning all sorts of negative values.
        T format option.
        mount options.
        sunOs filesystem type info.
    1.6
        ultrix bug fixes.
        add dynix to makefile.
    1.5
        sun had f_bfree instead of f_bavail!
        xenix, linux, sco
        -w, -W, -B.
        fixed width for -f M, -f S.
        usage.
        Allow other characters in format string.
        1.51 (local, pat@rwing)
            SunOS *does* support filesystem type info.  Its all in the
            mntent structure, but requires a small bit of work (see source).
    1.4
        -f B
        bcopy.
        solaris cdrom reports -2 for free blocks.
    1.3
        Command line specification of filenames.
        sort output.
        osf/1, ultrix.

    1.2
        # of inodes can be -1L
        return code for getDiskInfo shouldn't be checked.
        name of mount point must be maxpathlen.
