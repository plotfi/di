DESCRIPTION

  'di' is a disk information utility, displaying everything
  (and more) that your 'df' command does. It features the
  ability to display your disk usage in whatever format you
  prefer. It is designed to be highly portable. Great for
  heterogenous networks.

INSTALLATION

  To build:
    make -e dioptions.dat
    # Edit dioptions.dat and change it
    # to set your preferences.
    # Add your CC, CFLAGS and LDFLAGS settings.
    # This file will not be removed and can be reused
    # for the next release.
    make -e
    make -e install
  Example to change compiler and prefix:
    CC=gcc prefix=/opt/bin make -e

  If you don't have a bourne shell compatible shell,
  Try building with perl:
      make -e all-perl

  The CC, CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, prefix, LDFLAGS, and LIBS environment
  variables may be set and exported prior to running make.  This
  will override any settings in 'dioptions.dat'.

  The LOCALEDIR environment variable defaults to ${prefix}/share/locale.
  The installation uses the INSTALL_DIR (default ${prefix}),
  INSTALL_BIN_DIR ($INSTALL_DIR/bin), and INST_LOCALEDIR
  ($INSTALL_DIR/share/locale) environment variables for installation.

  The internationalization files are automatically built and installed if
  your system supports internationalization.

  Windows installation:
    Alternative 1 - uses config.win or config.mingw
      Cygwin gcc: cd C;make -e windows-gcc
      MinGW: cd C;mingw32-make MAKE=mingw32-make CC=mingw32-gcc windows-mingw
    Alternative 2 - builds a new config.h file (Cygwin).
      make -e config.h
      make -e

    You may need to change _lib_GetDiskFreeSpaceEX to 0
    in the config.h file for older windows systems.

  HP-UX:
    Some versions of gcc on HP-UX break the include files.
    If you see:    header: rpc/rpc.h ... no
    try: env CC=gcc CFLAGS="-D_LABEL_T" make -e

    On some HP-UX systems, quotactl isn't declared.
    If you want quota support, make sure config.h has:
      #define _lib_quotactl 1
      #define _args_quotactl 4
      #define _c_arg_1__quotactl int
      #define _c_arg_2__quotactl char *
      #define _c_arg_3__quotactl int
      #define _c_arg_4__quotactl caddr_t
      #define _quotactl_pos_1 0
      #define _quotactl_pos_2 1

    64-bit:
      env CFLAGS="-z +Z +DD64" LDFLAGS="+DD64" make -e
    64-bit gcc:
      env CC=gcc CFLAGS="-fPIC -mlp64 -D_LABEL_T" \
          LDFLAGS="-mlp64 -L/usr/lib/hpux64" make -e
    32-bit:
      env CFLAGS="-z +Z +DD32" LDFLAGS="+DD32" make -e
    32-bit gcc:
      env CC=gcc CFLAGS="-fPIC -milp32 -D_LABEL_T" \
          LDFLAGS="-milp32 -L/usr/lib/hpux32" make -e
    Bundled cc:
      cd C;make hpux-cc

  Tru64:
    export BIN_SH=svr4 beforehand.

  DragonFlyBSD:
    If quotas are not turned on in the kernel (/boot/loader.conf),
    the vquotactl interface will not be configured into di.  The
    default build available from DragonFly dports does not have
    the vquotactl interface turned on.

  Installation Permissions:
    Some old systems (Sys V variants) only allow root to read the
    mount table.  In SysV.4 and Solaris, the mount command would
    reset the permissions to be root readable only (fixed in Solaris 7).

    If this is needed on your system, do:
        make installperms

BUGS AND KNOWN ISSUES
    What's Not Tested:
      - pooled filesystems on Tru64.
        - I have access to a Tru64 system w/quotas, but there's
          only one filesystem per pool.
      - quotas:
        - MacOSX
          - No access to users with quotas.
      - MS VC++ has not been tested in a *very* long while.
      - A/UX, Cray, Irix, UNICOS, Next, Pyramid, SCO Unix, Sequent
        have not been tested in a *very* long while.
    Known Issues
      - quotas:
        - Solaris ufs requires the quotas file to be readable, or make
          the di program setuid.  Neither recommended.
        - Linux 2.4 - not working
        - HP-UX
          - quotactl() isn't declared. See HP-UX section above.
        - NetBSD 6
          - group quotas can't be fetched by ordinary users (EPERM).
            If the account is limited by a group quota, it won't be reported.
        - AIX 7
          - Unlike AIX 5, AIX 7 gives a permission
            denied error when a user tries to get their quota.
            Could make di suid, but that's not a good idea.
      - pooled filesystems:
        - hammer: the usage reported for pseudo-filesystems is the usage
          for the main pool.  Therefore the total used and size will be wrong.
        - btrfs: there's no way to identify the pools.

    Send bug reports along with the output from 'di -A -a -X 5',
    output from your standard df command (as verbose as possible),
    mkconfig.log, mkconfig_env.log, di.env, and config.h to:

        brad.lanam.di_at_gmail.com

    If the 'config.h' doesn't get set up correctly, please let me know.
    E-mail me the incorrect (and corrected if possible) config.h file,
    and any other information as appropriate.

        Added VMS.

        Code cleanup.

    4.18                                    [2009-11-29]
        Code cleanup.

        The default configuration method has been changed to
        use a shell script.  The perl configuration script is
        still available (./Build -mkpl).

    4.17                                    [2009-11-22]
        Totals have been changed to add up whatever filesystems
        are displayed.  This is more intuitive for the user.
        It is up to the user to exclude read-only filesystems
        (cdfs, iso9660), memory-based filesystems (memfs, mfs, tmpfs)
        and user filesystems (fuse*).  Excluding the 'fuse' type will
        exclude all fuse* filesystems.

        As before, only the main pool of a pooled filesystem is totaled.

        The build now works on unixware (getmntent is in libgen).
        The build now works on syllable.

        The default configuration method has been changed to
        use the perl script.  Removed iffe, as it doesn't support
        class testing.

    4.16                                    [2009-9-20]
        Fixed a nested macro issue on Mac OS X 10.6.
        Fixed bugs with filename arguments.

    4.15                                    [2009-9-17]
        Fixed filename argument w/non-printing filesystem.
        Build now works on Haiku.

    4.14                                    [2009-9-10]
        Code cleanup.
        Change size labels to match SI standards (1024 vs 1000).
        Build now works on Debian GNU-kFreeBSD.

    4.13                                    [2008-5-25]
        Fixed totals to correctly account for pooled filesystems.

    4.12                                    [19 Jan 2008]
        Change of e-mail addresses.

    4.11                                    [29 May 2007]
        Fixed minor bug for 'di -sn -t' introduced in 4.10.
        Code cleanup -- move global variables into local structures.
        Recoded sorting, added sort by filesystem type.

    4.10                                    [24 Feb 2007]
        Handle pooled filesystems so that the total space
        doesn't get added more than once.
        Compaq Tru64 advfs is untested.

    4.9                                     [2 Nov 2006]
        Fixed an uninitialized variable used for Solaris zones.
        Minor fixes to mkconfig.pl.

    4.8                                     [5 Oct 2006]
        Linux's statvfs() is not POSIX compliant and does not
        use f_frsize.  The correct value is returned in f_bsize.
        Since there's no way to tell which type of statvfs() is
        in use, we have to hard-code the logic for linux.
        This sucks.

        More minor improvements to mkconfig.pl.

        Add logic to find the correct msgfmt program to use.

    4.7                                     [23 Sep 2006]
        Changed the operation of the -a, -x and -I flags
        so that it is possible to specify -a and still exclude
        filesystems from the list.
        Added the -L flag to not check for duplicate filesystems.

    4.6                                     [3 Sep 2006]
        Improve mkconfig.pl configuration to be more robust,
        find needed libraries.  Improve mkconfig.pl portability.
