mkconfig - configuration tool (version 1.29)

Simply copy the entire directory structure as a sub-directory
in your application software.  Remove the man/ and examples/
directories.

Please e-mail any configuration units and the corresponding
manual page entry to brad.lanam.di_at_gmail.com.  They will be
included in the next release.


TESTING
    Version 1.20 D has been tested on:
      FreeBSD 8.2 (dmd2, gdc2, dmd1)
      LinuxMint 11 (dmd2, gdc2, ldc2, dmd1, gdc1)
      Debian 6 [64bit] (dmd2)

ISSUES
    - CFLAGS
      Needs to be reworked to separate CFLAGS in different categories.
      Standard, Application, User, Extra, etc.
    - D Compiler bugs:
      ldc2 has structure size problems on 64bit (issue #28).
      gdc 4.6.3 (LinuxMint) has structure size problems on 64bit.
