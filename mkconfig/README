TESTING
    Version 1.20 D has been tested on:
      FreeBSD 8.2 (dmd2, gdc2, dmd1)
      LinuxMint 11 (dmd2, gdc2, ldc2, dmd1, gdc1)
      Debian 6 [64bit] (dmd2)

ISSUES
    - CFLAGS
      Needs to be reworked to separate CFLAGS in different categories.
      Standard, Application, User, Extra, etc.
    - D Compiler bugs:
      ldc2 has structure size problems on 64bit (issue #28).
      gdc 4.6.3 (LinuxMint) has structure size problems on 64bit.
